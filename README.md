# Kfops

Kfops is an opinionated [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) "wrapper" to manage your 
pipelines and model deployment with use of dedicated python package and chatops commands. 
It simplifies and standardizes Kubeflow-based ML model lifecycle by enforcing 
"single repository per  ML model" rule and explicit way how it should be configured.
Commands like `/build`, `/build_run` and `/deploy` are executed in the context of the Pull Request.
